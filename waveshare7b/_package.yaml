# _package.yaml - Remote package reference for esphome-rental-display
# Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B | 1024x600
#
# NOTE: ESPHome does NOT recursively process a `packages:` block found inside
# a remotely-fetched file. Use `files:` (plural) in your local yaml instead,
# listing each file individually. This file is kept for reference only.
#
# Correct usage in your local esphome.yaml (ESPHome 2026.2.0+):
#
#   packages:
#     - url: https://github.com/trentrae/esphome-rental-display
#       ref: main
#       files:
#         - waveshare7b/device.yaml
#         - waveshare7b/common.yaml
#         - waveshare7b/substitutions.yaml
#         - waveshare7b/layouts/fonts.yaml
#         - waveshare7b/layouts/colors.yaml
#         - waveshare7b/layouts/main.yaml
#         - waveshare7b/layouts/update_intervals_pkg.yaml
#       refresh: 0s
#
# Your local yaml must also define:
#   - esphome: (name, friendly_name)
#   - substitutions: (see substitutions.yaml.example for all required keys)
#   - wifi:, api:, ota:, logger:
